- **Project Manager (PM):** Oversees timelines, budgets, and overall project delivery. Facilitates communication between stakeholders and developers.
- **UI/UX Designer:** Designs user-centric interfaces and experiences, ensuring functionality and usability.
- **Software Architect:** Defines the technical architecture, selects tools, and sets standards for code quality and scalability.
- **Software Developer:** Implements functionality, solves coding challenges, and builds the core application features.
- **QA Engineer:** Tests functionality and performance to ensure the product meets both functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Test Automation Engineer:** Builds automated test suites to ensure consistent and scalable testing throughout development.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Builds and maintains CI/CD pipelines, ensures smooth deployments, and bridges development and operations.

### 2. Technology Stack Overview (Mandatory)

**Objective:** Deepen understanding of the technologies used.

#### 🧰 Technology Stack

- **Django:** Backend web framework for building APIs and server-side logic.
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL:** Relational database to store structured data such as users, properties, and bookings.
- **GraphQL:** Query language for APIs enabling flexible, client-driven data fetching.
- **Docker:** Containerization tool to ensure consistent environments across development and deployment.
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD automation to run tests, build code, and deploy changes efficiently.
- **Celery:** A distributed task queue used for executing background jobs like sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis:** In-memory data store used for caching, session management, and as a message broker for Celery.

### 🗄️ Database Design

- **Users**: id, username, email, password_hash, profile_picture
- **Properties**: id, title, description, location, price, owner_id
- **Bookings**: id, user_id, property_id, check_in, check_out, status
- **Payments**: id, booking_id, amount, status, transaction_date
- **Reviews**: id, property_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at

**Entity Relationships**:

- A user can own many properties
- A booking is linked to one property and one user
- A review belongs to a user and a property

### 4. Feature Breakdown (Mandatory)

**Objective:** Identify and describe the main features of the application.

#### ✨ Feature Breakdown

- **User Management:** Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Property Listings:** Property owners can create, update, and delete listings with descriptions and images.
- **Search and Booking:** Users can search properties by location and date, and make bookings.
- **Review System:** Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties they've booked.
- **Payment Integration:** Secure payment flow for booking confirmations using third-party payment gateways.
